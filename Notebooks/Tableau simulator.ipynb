    "## Stabilizer formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of keeping track of a $2^n$ size array describing the state of the system, we can, for a certain class of circuits called Clifford circuits, use $n$ stabilizer operators to describe our system, and so only have to store $n \\times 2n$ values. This is possible since we can find $n$ stabilizers that uniquely determine the state of the system (and thus are the generators for the group $S$ that stabilizes the system). Importantly, these generators are a subset of the $n$ qubit Pauli group $G_n$, which is constructed from all possible tensor product combinations of $n$ operators from the single qubit Pauli group $G_1 = \\{\\pm I, \\pm i I, \\pm X, \\pm i X, \\pm Y, \\pm i Y, \\pm Z, \\pm i Z \\}$.\n",

    "An operator $U$ stabilizes $|\\psi\\rangle$ iff\n",
    "$$ U |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle $$\n",

    "\n",
    "So $(1-\\alpha)U_1 + \\alpha U_2$ also stabilizes the system.\n",

    "### Evolving the stabilizers\n",
    "\n",
    "So we know that we can encode the state by keeping track of $n$ generators, and following the typical procedure of starting our circuit in state $|\\psi\\rangle = |0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$, we know that our initial generators are $n$ operators $Z_i$ working on qubit $i$ respectively. The first question then is how do we evolve these generators as we add gates to the circuit?\n",

    "$$ U |\\psi\\rangle = U g |\\psi\\rangle = (U g U^\\dagger) U |\\psi\\rangle $$\n",

For Hadamard, S, CNOT, X, Y and Z gates, outputs for given input stabilizers can be found in table 10.7 of page 460 in \"Quantum computation and information\" by Nielsen and Chuang. Of special interest is that these gates map elements of the subset $\\{ I, X, Y, Z\\}$ to another element of this subset (see table). We will see later in the function `rowsum(h,j)` that it is usefull to know that the prefactor to the stabilizers will allways remain real under addition of new Clifford gates when we start from a state of only $Z$ operators.\n",

    "\n",
    "We only need operators $I_j$, $X_j$, $Y_j$ and $Z_j$ to describe any generator, and need to store $n$ generators consisting of $n$ single qubit operators. Furthermore, we can express $Y_j=iX_jZ_j$. Thus the check matrix is a good way to encode the generators, ie. we keep track of the existence of $X_j$ and $Z_j$ in qubit number $j$'s operator of the generator $g^{(i)}$. We also have to keep track of the sign of $g^{(i)}$. The check matrix looks like follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "Each row corresponds to a generator. So the single qubit operator on qubit $j$ in generator $g^{(i)}$ is: $I$ if $x_{ij} = z_{ij} = 0$, $X$ if $x_{ij} = 1$ and $z_{ij} = 0$, $Z$ if $x_{ij} = 0$ and $z_{ij} = 1$, $Y$ if $x_{ij} = z_{ij} = 1$. It can be easily seen that the inital matrix for the $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$ state is $(0|I)$.\n",

    "### Measuring a qubit\n",
    "Measuring the $a$'th qubit **in the computational basis** corresponds to applying the operator $Z_a$ to our system. We then project the qubit onto either $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$. There are two possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All generators commute with $Z_a$, ie. there is no $X_a$ single qubit operator in any of the generators $g$.\n",
    "- One or more generators anti-commute with $Z_a$, ie. there is a $X_a$ single qubit operator in one or more of the generators $g$. But if $g^{(q)}$ and $g^{(j)}$ both anti-commute with $Z_a$, then $g^{(q)} g^{(j)}$ commutes with $Z_a$, and we can replace $g^{(j)}$ with $g^{(q)} g^{(j)}$ which is also a generator for the group that stabilizes $|\\psi\\rangle$. So without loss of generality, we can allways choose a set of generators such that only one of them anti-commutes with a given Pauli operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case $Z_a |\\psi\\rangle = Z_a g|\\psi\\rangle = g Z_a |\\psi\\rangle$, so the generators $g$ stabilize $Z_a |\\psi\\rangle$ and the system remains unchanged by the measurement. The $a$'th qubit is in a predetermined eigenstate of $Z_a$, we just need to find out if the eigenvalue is $+1$ (ie. $|0\\rangle$) or $-1$ (ie. $|1\\rangle$). The task is essentially to find which of $Z_a$ and $-Z_a$ is in the subgroup $S$. An effective way to determine this is presented later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case it can be shown (see proof below) that there is a 50% probability of measuring either +1 or -1. Assuming $Z_a$ anti-commutes with $g^{(q)}$, we replace all other generators $g^{(j)}$ that anti-commute with $Z_a$ with $g^{(q)} g^{(j)}$ so that all generators except $g^{(q)}$ now commute with $Z_a$. Since the measurement forces qubit $a$ to either state $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ we must replace $g^{(q)}$ with $Z_a$ if we measure $+1$ and $-Z_a$ if we measure $-1$, since we know that $Z_a$ or $-Z_a$ now must stabilize the system after the measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Proof of measurement probablility for case 2\n",
    "Since the eigenvalues of the operators $\\pm Z_a$ are $\\pm 1$, their projectors are $(I \\pm Z_a)/2$. Thus the measurement probabilities are\n",
    "$$p(+1) = \\text{tr}\\left(\\frac{I+Z_a}{2} |\\psi\\rangle \\langle\\psi|\\right)$$\n",
    "$$p(-1) = \\text{tr}\\left(\\frac{I-Z_a}{2} |\\psi\\rangle \\langle\\psi|\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $Z_a$ anti-commutes with $g^{(q)}$ we have $Z_a g^{(q)} = -g^{(q)} Z_a$. Also, we have $g^{(q)} |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$. So\n",
